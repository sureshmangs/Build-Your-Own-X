## [Build Your Own WC Tool](ccwc/C%2B%2B)

The ccwc counts various statistics of a text file, such as the number of lines, words, characters, and bytes. It takes command-line arguments to specify the operation and the file to be analyzed.


## [Build Your Own JSON Parser](JSON-Parser/C%2B%2B)

The JSON Parser does the parsing and validation of data in a format resembling JSON. It starts by breaking down the input data into individual tokens through lexical analysis. Then, it proceeds to parse and validate the data structure, ensuring that it conforms to the expected JSON-like format. It ultimately determines whether the input data is "VALID JSON" or "INVALID JSON" based on the correctness of its structure.


## [Build Your Own Compression Tool](Huffman-Encoder-Decoder/C%2B%2B)

The Huffman compression and decompression utility designed to efficiently compress and decompress text data. It performs the compression and decompression of files using the Huffman coding algorithm, a popular method for data compression.


## [Build Your Own Web Server](Web-Server/C%2B%2B)

A simple, extensible TCP server implementation. It handles HTTP requests, processes them via worker threads, and sends appropriate responses using predefined route handlers. It supports multiple HTTP methods and content types, ensuring efficient handling of client connections and requests.
